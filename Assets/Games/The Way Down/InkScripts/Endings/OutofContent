You find a house, it seems to be the same one you left, all those years ago. Do you enter? 
*I can't go back.
Why not?
    **I left for a reason.
    --
    Fair, but just so you know, there isn't anything else beyond this house.
        ***I would rather walk forever than go back.
         And that is what you do. #END
        ->Conclusion
        ***Maybe it's best for me to return home.
           ->enter
*Sure.
->enter


==enter
 But for how long?
            ***Until I forget everything.
            ->enddyd
            ***Until I'm ready to go out again.
            ->enddyd
            ***Until the world changes.
            ->enddyd
            
            
==enddyd  
And that is what you do. #END
