~Strange = "Turtle"
As you approach the tower, you notice that it is not made with stone, but of many turtles, stacked on top of each other.
-
The turtle at the bottom of the stack is humming quietly to himself. They can't see you.
*Approach the final turtle.
->approachT
*Attempt to climb the tower.

//IF START BY APPROACH==============================

"hello, nice to meet you...". The turtle is friendly, and has many scars across it's face.

*"Can I climb up the tower?"
    ->AskClimb
*How are you?"
    The turtle looks surprised "I'm. Ok. Thanks for asking, how are you?"
    **I'm Confused.
    Why?
        ***I don't understand this tower.
        I don't really know either. I just know we've always been this way. 
            ****How come you haven't fallen over yet. 
            I don't know, good luck I guess.

            The turtle looks nervous "I would say it's best not to think about it"
        ***Everyone around here is weird.
            I know, I try to remember that they're just trying to cope with...all this.

=AskClimb
    The turtle's eye twitches, "I wouldn't recommend it"
        **Why not?
          Another eye twitch, "Whenever a being of your kind attempts to climb to the summit, they eventually fall down"
            ***"What if I promise not to fall"
            The turtle takes a nervous breath "Um, just...think about it...ok"
                ****I was joking.
                The turtle relaxes "sorry, I didn't know if...please don't hurt yourself"
                    *****I won't.
                    *****I'm not promising anything.

        **But you would allow me to do it?
        "I can't stop you"...The turtle looks around the landscape.
            ***Climb the turtle.
                You ignore the turtle and start to climb onto its shell, the turtle starts to quietly cry.

//IF START BY CLIMBING SECTION==============================


==climb
From the back you start to grab onto the the turtles shell, you manage to climb up on its shell
*Make too much noise.
*Don't make any noise.
-
The turtle says "you know I can feel you on my skin right?"
*Say nothing.
"I don't mind, seriously, but If you continue to climb, know that some of the other turtles do. Trust me, you don't want to fall off."
    **Continue climbing.
    **Get down and talk to the turtle.
    ->ClimbTalk
    --
    "Ok, well, I guess I can't stop you, Can I give you just one piece of advice?"
        **"yes"
        **"no"
        **Remain silent
        --
        "Make sure you climb high enough so that you die when you fall off, you don't want to be stuck being half alive"
        ***Climb down.
        "Good choice, my friend, Good choice. Come round to see me and we can talk."
        ->ClimbTalk
        ***Keep Climbing  
        As you wish friends.

"hello, nice to meet you...". The turtle is friendly, and has many scars across it's face.
    *...
    -
    "just so we start on the right foot, could I ask you why you wanted to..climb..us."
    *I wanted a challenge.
    hmm, well, you can still find challenges without putting yourself in danger.
        **yeah, but...I like the danger.
        ->young
        **Could you give me a goal then?
        ->goals
    *I wanted to jump off.
    The turtle looks a little sad. "I'm sorry, that you felt that way, not that I can blame you, there isn't much to do down here"
        **Clarifying it was for fun.
        ->young
        **...
        "It is difficult, living down here, but that doesn't mean you can't find something to do."
            ***Could you give me an idea?
            ->goals
    *I wanted to see what's at the top.
    Would it deter any future attempts if I said that, there's nothing much up there. Just more turtles.
        **How do you know that? 
        "every so often, the weight of the tower crushs the turtle at the bottom, so I got to see what was up there."
            ***You must be near death then.
            It only happens once an infinity, so I'm not too worried. 
                ****Stil, You must be in a lot of pain, with all those turtles on your back.
                You get used to it, sometimes. Thank you for your concern. ->endconvisation
        **I still want to check for myself.
            ->young

You Continue to climb up the tower of turtles. Eventually you...
*Reach the top.
It takes forever, but you eventually reach the top. #END
->END
*Fall off.
It climb forever, but you eventually fall off.#END
->END



=young
"oh, you must be quite young then?"
    *"what do you mean"
    Well, if you want to survive down here for as long as the others have, you can't take risks like that.
        **How so?
        Since beings live forever, the only way they can die is by being killed. Which means that if a being takes any risk, they will eventually be killed by it.  
            ***Sounds like life isn't worth it.
            ->endconvisation
            ***How do you survive for a long time down here?
             It's difficult, but because I'm pinned down by the weight of the tower, I don't have a choice but to continue.
                 ****So I do?
                 ->endconvisation
                 ****Have you seen what other beings do?
                    The ones that decide to stay around seem to invent hobbies for themselves, keep themselves busy. Distracted.
                    ->endconvisation
    *"I'll have you know i'm {~age}."
    That is quite young,
        **How old are you then? 
        I've always been, so it's a little different.
            ***How can that be?
            I don't know, but it is true.
            ->endconvisation
            ***How come I've been alive.
            I don't know, quite honestly I'm surprised that anything else lives down here. Life finds a way I guess.

=goals
"I don't know, I've tried giving beings many times. It never ends well.
*Why?
They complete them too quickly, then it's back to asking questions from me.
    **Could you just give me an impossible goal then, so I don't return.
    I've tried that before, eventually the being convinces themselves that they did complete the task, even when they haven't.
        ***I won't.
         ->endconvisation
        ***Could you give me one regardless
        ->endconvisation
        ***That reminds me, a small being told me to give you this.
        ->SmallBeing


    
=SmallBeing
"keep it, that small being has been annoying me forever"
*They seemed to speak highly of you.
That's funny, considering that all they do is talk, and never listen.
    **Why?
    ->endconvisation

==endconvisation
The turtle smiles, notices his smile, then frowns.
    *What's wrong?
    "it's been lovely talking, but I think it's best that you go now"
        **"why?"
            "...i can't tell you without hurting you more than I already have."
                    ***Demand further explanation.
                    The turtle exhales. "The more I answer your questions, the more you will notice how dire this world is, and that awareness itself causes pain.
                        ****"You're wrong, I'm not in pain"
                        Maybe not today, but eventually the awareness will get to you, as it gets to everyone.
                            *****"It won't get to me"
                                  I hope so.

                            *****"If that's true, then why are you fine.
                            I don't know. I don't think I am. I don't have a choice if I live or die.
                            ->endturlte
                            *****If it's inevitable, then why does it matter when it happens.
                                "it matters to me"
                                ->endturlte
                        ****Then why talk to me at all?
                        "Because I know your kind, it doesn't end well if I refuse to talk"
                            *****What happens?
                                The turtle looks at the ground "They, eventually, turn against me."
                                ->endturlte
