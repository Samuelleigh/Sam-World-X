As you approach the tower, you find that it is made of many turtles stacked on top of each other. They all appear to be asleep, apart from the final turtle, who is humming quietly to themself. They can't see you. #m #0

    Why?
        ***"I don't understand this tower."
        ~ addAwareness(10)
        I don't really know either. I just know we've always been this way.

            I don't know, luck I guess.

        ***"I don't think I'm real."

"You must be quite young then?"

    Well, if you want to survive down here for as long as the others have, you can't take risks like that.
        **"How so?"
        ~ addAwareness(4)
        Since Beings live forever, the only way they can die is by being killed. Which means that if a being takes any risk, they will eventually be killed by it.

             It's difficult, but because I'm pinned down by the weight of the tower, I don't have a choice but to continue.

    I've tried that before, eventually the Being convinces themselves that they did complete the task, even when they haven't.
