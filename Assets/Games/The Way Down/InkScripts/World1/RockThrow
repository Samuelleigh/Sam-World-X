As you walk, the being stays in place, they shout "Don't stop until you find the end"
    *Do as they say.
    You do as they say...for a long time...but then you get bored
        **Defy them.
        Oh look, nothing happened.
        ->OverWorld
        **Better not, just in case.

Eventully someone finds you, they remove the rock from your skull, and feed you a potion. You try to thank them, but they're gone before you're healed.
