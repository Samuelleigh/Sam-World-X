In the distance, you see a tower, extending towards the sky.
*Walk to it.
You walk towards it, you notice it's odd shape.
    **Look up.
    The tower is so tall, it looks like it extends forever.
    ->almost
*Ignore it.
->almost

==almost
As the tower draws closer, you notice gaint, non-being limbs jut out, some look like they're trying to swim
    *Walk further.
    Something jabs at your foot, you look to see a small being jab at your foot.
        **"What do you want?"
        "Are you going to talk to the final turtle?"
            ***The what?
                "The final turtle of turtle tower, he's a smart one, I have so much to learn from him."
                ****Oh, yes, I am going to talk to him.
                    ->goodgood
                ****No, But I will see him.
                ->godowhat
            ***Yes
                ->goodgood
        **Kick them aside
        You lightly kick the being to the ground, they look unharmed. "Fine, be like that then"
            ***Continue walking.
            ->OverWorld
            
==goodgood
    Good Good, I talk so much with him, whenever I can, inbetween the times he tells me to do something of course.
            *Will he ask me to do Something
            Depends, most of his followers give up on him eventully.
                            **Doesn't sound like that good a leader.
                            It is inevitable, we all live so long down here.
                            ->GivehimThis.
                            **Why havn't you?
                            I don't know, I think I'm just just more committed.
                            ->GivehimThis.
           
==godowhat
"then what are you going to do"
*I'm going to kill him
"why?"
    **he's an asshole"
    The being looks visably hurt, "everyone is entitled to their opinions"
        ->GivehimThis.
    **I want to see what happens
    Well, not to be a buzzkill, but I already know what happens.
        ***What?
        "Well, then the next one falls on top of it.
            ****Then I'll kill that one
            "Won't you get bored"
                *****no.
                Good for you. ->GivehimThis.
                *****yes, but that won't stop me.
                "You must be new to this world, huh. Well if your going to be like that, I would advice you don't think about it ay more than you are now.
                    ******sure, whatever
                    "that's the spirit...<>->Givehimthishurt
                    ******Why.
                    I don't know, I just know that when I've seen people thinking, they tend to...off themselves, Eventully.
                        *******I'll keep that in mind
                        ->Givehimthishurt
                        *******Why.
                        The being looks around nerviously ->Givehimthishurt
            ****Ok, well I don't care about that one.
                "right...-<>->Givehimthishurt 
        ***Don't spoil it.
        "ok...as you wish...<>->Givehimthishurt 
    **It's about time
    "hmmm, perhaps in a sense <> ->Givehimthishurt
*I'm going to listen
"hmmm, intresting, I should try that next time I reach him.<> ->GivehimThis.

*"I'm going to climb him"
The being chuckles. "Everyone needs a hobby I guess, <>
