In the distance, you see a tower. #m #0
//Shot of the turtle tower, you can barely make it out.
*Look up.
    The tower is so tall, it looks like it extends forever.#m #1
    ~ addAwareness(10)
    **Walk towards it.
    ->almost
*Ignore it.
->jab

==almost
As the tower draws closer, you notice giant limbs jut out, some look like they're trying to swim. #m #2
    *Walk further.
     ~ addAwareness(10)
    ->jab
    
==jab
    Something jabs at your foot, you look to see a small being. #m #3
        **"What do you want?"
        "Are you going to talk to the final turtle?"
            ***"The what?"
                "The final turtle of turtle tower, he's a smart one, I have so much to learn from him."
                ****"Oh, yes, I am going to talk to him."
                    ->goodgood
                ****"No, But I will see him."
                ->godowhat
            ***"Yes."
                ->goodgood
        **Kick them aside.
         ~ addKneecaps(1)
        You lightly kick the being to the ground, they look unharmed. "Fine, be like that then" #m #4
            ***Continue walking.
            ->OverWorld
            
==goodgood
    Good Good, I talk so much with him, whenever I can, in between the times he tells me to do something of course.
            *"Will he ask me to do something?"
            Depends, most of his followers give up on him eventually, so he might not bother anymore.
                            **"Doesn't sound like that good a leader."
                            It is inevitable for people to give, we all live so long down here.
                            ->GivehimThis.
                            **"Why haven't you?"
                            I don't know, I think I'm just more committed.
                            ->GivehimThis.
           
==godowhat
"Then what are you going to do"
*"I'm going to kill him."
"Why?"
    **"He's an asshole".
    The being looks visibly hurt. "Everyone is entitled to their opinions".
        ->GivehimThis.
    **"I want to see what happens when he dies."
    Well, not to be a buzzkill, but I already know what happens.
        ***"What?"
        "Well, then the next one falls on top of it.
            ****"Then I'll kill that one."
            "Won't you get bored?"
                *****"No."
                Good for you. ->GivehimThis.
                *****"Yes, but that won't stop me."
                "You must be new to this world, huh. Well if you're going to be like that, I would advise you don't think about it any more than you are now.
                    ******"Sure, whatever."
                    "that's the spirit...<>->Givehimthishurt
                    ******"Why?"
                    I don't know, I just know that when I've seen people thinking, they tend to...die...Eventually.
                        *******"I'll keep that in mind."
                        ->Givehimthishurt
                        *******"Why?"
                        The being looks around nervously. They change the subject ->Givehimthishurt
            ****"So? I only care about the current one."
                "right...-<>->Givehimthishurt 
        ***"Don't spoil it."
        "ok...as you wish...<>->Givehimthishurt 
    **"It's about time."
    "hmmm, perhaps in a sense <> ->Givehimthishurt
*"I'm going to listen."
"hmmm, interesting, I should try that next time I reach him.<> ->GivehimThis.

*"I'm going to climb him, and then the entire tower."
The being chuckles. "Everyone needs a hobby I guess, <>

In any case, when you reach him, can you give him this?" 
    *Take potion. #p #3
        "It's very important to me if you give this to him"
        **Didn't you hear that I was going to kill him.
            "I know, I know, but in case you change your mind."

    *Take potion.
        "it's very important" #p #3
        **"Why can't you do it yourself?"
        I'm so much smaller than you, It'll probably take forever for me to reach him.
            ***"I'll think about it."
