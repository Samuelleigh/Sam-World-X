=expectingPackage
Oh, ok, I wasn't expecting anything today, are you sure you've got the right address.
*This 29 KingsWood Lane?
Sorry, this is 15 Kay Spur street.
    **Do you know where I can find that address?
    Honestly, no. I don't think I've ever heard of Kingswood Lane, not in this town. 
        ***Ok, thank you anyway. 
        No worries. ->END
        ***Could I leave the package with you then.
        ummm......no. ->END
    **Sorry, that was what I meant to say.
    ummm, ok. So where is the package then? ->WherePackage
*Are you Darren Smith?
    Nope. He lives on the other side of town.
    **Do you know his address?
    Not off by heart, I have it written down inside though, If you wait I can get it. 
        ***No, that's fine.
        It's no bother. 
            ****OK sure.
            I'll just shut this door to stop the cold getting in. ->END
            ****OK, just could you leave the door open.
              ummm...that's a bit...goodbye. ->END #concerned
            ****Goodbye.
            Oh, ok, good luck. ->END
        ***OK sure. 
             I'll just shut this door to stop the cold getting in. ->END

*I'm sorry sir.
Sure, whatever, where is my package? #annoyed
*Is there a warrant for your arrest?
Very funny, where is my package?#annoyed
*What, so I can't knock creatively?
    You call that racket creative? #annoyed
    **Can you suggest a better way of knocking creatively?
    Really? Ok. I have one friend that knocks quickly 6 times, then just stops. That's at least something.
        ***Thank you.
        Sure. Whatever. Where is my package? #annoyed
    **Yes.
