==Intro

:0 Two professors are chatting in the front left corner of the cafe. They've been friends for acouple years now, and it's slowly become a tradition to get togther at the end of finals to bitch and moan about the internal politics of their respective depeartments. It's not that either professor actually care about the drama per say, more that it's a way of blowing off steam accumulated from having end of semester stress of finding ways to boast failing students grades from an F to a D+.
